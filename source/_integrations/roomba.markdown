The **Roomba** {% term integrations %} allows you to control your [iRobot Roomba](https://www.irobot.com/roomba) vacuum or [iRobot Braava](https://www.irobot.com/braava) m-series mop.

</p>

{% note %}
This {% term integrations %}  has been tested and confirmed to be working with the iRobot Roomba s9+, Roomba 980, Roomba 960, Roomba 890, and Braava jet m6 models, but should also work fine with any Wi-Fi enabled Roomba or Braava like the 690. For auto-discovery, you will need to initiate a Roomba reboot. For example, by holding the clean button for up to 20 seconds on an i7 or 980. [More information about rebooting your robot](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/9087).
{% endnote %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% warning %}
The Roomba's MQTT server only allows a single connection. Continuous mode is enabled by default, which will force the App to connect via the cloud to your Roomba. Continuous mode can be disabled in the configuration options for the integration after it is added. For more information, refer to the [Roomba 980 repository](https://github.com/NickWaterton/Roomba980-Python#firmware-2xx-notes).
{% endwarning %}

## Integration entities

The **Roomba** {% term integrations %} will add the following sensors.

Sensors:

- **Battery**: The status of your battery
- **Bin full** (if Roomba has the capacity to do): If the bin is full
- **Canceled missions**: Total number of missions that have been canceled
- **Failed missions**: Total number of missions that have failed
- **Successful missions**: Total number of successful missions
- **Average mission time**: The amount of time a mission took on average
- **Total missions**: The total number of all missions
- **Scrubs**: Total number of times the robot has executed a "scrub"
- **Total cleaning time**: How many hours the robot has spent cleaning in total
- **Total cleaned area**: The total area in mÂ² the robot has cleaned

### Retrieving your credentials

Check if the credentials can be retrieved directly from your device:

1. Make sure the Roomba app is closed on all of your devices.
2. Follow the instructions in Home Assistant to retrieve the credentials.

If automatic retrieval does not work, you can retrieve the credentials manually. To manually retrieve both the BLID (username) and the password, refer to the instructions in the [Roomba 980](https://github.com/NickWaterton/Roomba980-Python#how-to-get-your-usernameblid-and-password) or [dority 980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980#how-to-get-your-usernameblid-and-password) repository.

For Home Assistant Container, the following command retrieves the BLID (username) and password:

```shell
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID python -c 'import roombapy.entry_points; roombapy.entry_points.password()' ROOMBA_IP
```

{% note %}
The command to retrieve the credentials does not need any additional software to be installed because it uses the built-in [roombapy](https://github.com/pschmitt/roombapy) package and [password](https://github.com/pschmitt/roombapy/blob/1.6.1/roomba/entry_points.py#L20) function deployed with Home Assistant.
{% endnote %}

#### Retrieving credentials from the cloud with dorita980

The underlying Python library is currently unable to retrieve the credentials from some newer models (for example, the J7). See [this issue](https://github.com/pschmitt/roombapy/issues/97) for details. Luckily, the password can be retrieved from the cloud using a tool provided by the [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) library. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980#how-to-get-your-usernameblid-and-password) to do this, you should receive output of the form:

```shell
Found 1 robot(s)!
Robot "RoombaJ7" (sku: j715800 SoftwareVer: sapphire+22.21.1+2022-06-02-570490a425b+Firmware-Production+70):
BLID=> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Password=> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <= Yes, all this string.

Use this credentials in dorita980 lib :)
```

Copy the password (everything between `=>` and `<=`, not including leading and trailing whitespace) into the Home Assistant password dialog.

## Vacuuming a Specific Room or Zone
It is possible to use existing (or create new) rooms or clean zones in the iRobot app and start a vacuum job in that area using Home Assistant.

Using the `vacuum.send_command` action, you can run a `start` command with additional parameters that include iRobot-specific information about the associated map references (called the `pmap_id` and `user_pmapv_id`) and a list of areas (known as `regions`) in the order that they should be cleaned.

{% warning %}
Automations may start to fail if your map is updated in the iRobot app. When the map is updated, the `user_pmapv_id` currently gets "reset" to the timestamp of when the change was made. You may need to retrieve the value periodically depending on your usage of the iRobot app.
{% endwarning %}

Example parameters:
```yaml
pmap_id: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XXXX
regions:
  - region_id: "X"
    type: zid # zid is a Zone ID
  - region_id: "X"
    type: rid # rid is a Room ID
user_pmapv_id: YYMMDDTHHMMSS # Changes when a map is updated
```
*When listing multiple `regions`, each region will be cleaned in the order in which it is listed.*

### Retrieving Parameters
To find your `pmap_id`, the `user_pmapv_id`, and the `region_id` and `type` associated with each of your rooms and zones, you can to intiate a job from the iRobot app and retrieve the information from Home Assistant logs.

1. Enable debug logging for the Roomba integration (you will disable this at the end).
2. In the iRobot app, start a new job using your target regions (rooms or zones).
3. Go to Home Assistant **Settings** > **System** > **Logs**.
4. Select **Show raw logs** from the three-dots menu.
5. In the search box on the Logs page, search for `lastCommand` and locate the most recent entry containing the "start" command.
6. Make note of the values for the following attributes: 
    - `pmap_id`
    - `user_pmapv_id`
    - Within the list of `regions`, record each of the values:
        - `region_id`
        - `type` (this will be either `rid` for Rooms, or `zid` for Clean Zones)
7. Enter the respective values in the parameters area (along with the `start` command and chosen vacuum entity) for the `vacuum.send_command` action.
    - This action can be used in any of the standard methods provided by Home Assistant, including Scripts, Automations, or testing using the Actions menu in the Developer tools pages.
8. Disable debug logging for the Roomba integration.
9. You may also cancel your cleaning job that was started to retrieve the values.

{% note %}
To retrieve many room or zone `region_id` values at a time, you can create your manual job in the iRobot app with any (or all) rooms/zones selected, and they will listed in the `lastComand` in the same order that they were "tapped" in the app. You can then reference the names of the zones/rooms in the iRobot app to document their respective `region_id` for later use.
{% endnote %}

Example of a log line for the `lastCommand` search:

```shell
1970-01-01 00:00:00.000 DEBUG (Thread-1 (_thread_main)) [homeassistant.components.roomba.vacuum] Got new state from the vacuum: {'state': {'reported': {'lastCommand': {'command': 'start', 'time': 0000000000, 'initiator': 'rmtApp', 'pmap_id': 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XXXX', 'regions': [{'params': {'noAutoPasses': True, 'twoPass': False}, 'region_id': 'X', 'type': 'zid'}], 'user_pmapv_id': 'YYMMDDTHHMMSS', 'favorite_id': None, 'ordered': 1, 'event': None}}}}
```

Example of script using `vacuum.send_command` with room-specifying parameters:

```yaml
alias: Vacuum Kitchen Rug
sequence:
  - target:
      device_id: ROOMBA_DEVICE_ID_POPULATED_BY_HOMEASSISTANT
    data:
      command: start
      params:
        pmap_id: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XXXX
        regions:
          - region_id: "0"
            type: zid
        user_pmapv_id: YYMMDDTHHMMSS
    action: vacuum.send_command
mode: single
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Integration wizard shows "Failed to connect" after submitting the password**: Before attempting a factory reset (which can be a cumbersome process), attempt submitting the password in the integration wizard while the Roomba is actively running (i.e. cleaning). Avoid opening the app to start a manual job to help with this. Instead, push the physical clean button on the device directly to start the manual job. This appears to resolve the issue on some models because they answer queries only while actively running.

  If this still does not resolve the issue, factory reset the model.
